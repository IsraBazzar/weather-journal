This project is required to complete the requirements Frontend Nanodegree by Udacity, as an application on using web API with node server.

## Development Strategy
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- I started by cloning the starter code provided by Udacity.
- Then I added my design (colors, font style, and some other) from my last project, since I preferred to unify my works.
- I walked through project rubric to accomplish the project musts and requirements.
